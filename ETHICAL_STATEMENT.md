# Ethical and Responsible Use Statement

This repository contains code developed as part of the `Anonymized Project` project. The objective of this project is to enhance human-robot interaction by enabling robots to represent and query spatially grounded semantic information efficiently. Given the potential applications of this technology, we emphasize the following considerations for ethical and responsible use:

## 1. Respect for Privacy and Data Protection
The code is designed to process spatial and symbolic data. While `Anonymized Project` itself does not collect any personal information, user-developed `Anonymized Project` plugins could do. In this case, users are strongly advised to comply with local and international privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) and ensure that any data collected respects individuals' privacy and consent.

## 2. Avoidance of Harm and Misuse
The algorithms and data structures provided here are intended to improve interaction and assistive capabilities of robots. They should not be used for purposes that could harm individuals, such as unauthorized surveillance or manipulation of individuals' behaviors.

## 3. Transparency and Accountability
Users and developers building upon this code should ensure transparency in their applications, disclosing how the system functions, the data it uses, and its intended outcomes. Developers are encouraged to implement logging and monitoring to provide accountability and facilitate auditing of system behaviors.

## 4. Bias and Fairness
The system relies on semantic representation, which may include classification of objects and human actions. Developers should be aware of potential biases in the training data or the models used, and take steps to mitigate them. This includes conducting regular audits and ensuring diverse datasets are used to train the models, to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or discriminatory behaviors.

## 5. Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards
The implementation of this code should comply with ethical guidelines for human-robot interaction research, such as the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and other relevant professional standards. Users should also adhere to local regulations concerning the deployment of robotic systems in public and private spaces.

By following these guidelines, users of this repository can contribute to the responsible and ethical advancement of human-robot interaction technologies. The developers of this code are committed to fostering its use in a manner that respects human rights and promotes beneficial societal outcomes.
